# MalViz: An Interactive Visualization Tool for Tracing Malware

## Abstract
This demonstration paper introduces Malviz, a visual analytic tool for analyzing malware behavioral patterns through process monitoring events. The goals of this tool are: 1)  to investigate the relationship and dependencies among processes interacted with a running malware over a certain period of time, 2) to support professional security experts in detecting and recognizing unusual signature-based patterns exhibited by a running malware, and 3) to help users identify infected system and users' libraries that the malware has reached and possibly tampered. A case study is conducted in a virtual machine environment with a sample of four malware programs. The result of the case study shows that the visualization tool offers a great support for experts in software and system analysis and digital forensics to observe and profile malicious behavior and identify the traces of affected software artifacts
